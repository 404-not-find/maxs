* What is MAXS?
MAXS is short for *M*odular *A*ndroid *X*MPP *S*ervice. It is an
Android service that creates an XMPP connection and allows some
predefined JIDs, called "Master JIDs" to use this service.

It is the successor of GTalkSMS, and hence MAXS shares many ideas with
GTalkSMS. In fact we hope that MAXS will share the same feature set as
GTalkSMS at some point.

* Modular!
MAXS is split into a main app, which we refer to as "main" from now on
and various modules. It is the job of main to establish a stable XMPP
connection, forward incoming commands to the modules and send the
answer message from the modules back to the origin.
