* What is MAXS?

MAXS is an acronym for *M* odular *A* ndroid *X* MPP *S* ervice and
consists of /modules/, /transports/ and the /main/ application.

/Modules/ provide the specialized functionality. For example the
bluetoothadmin module allows you to enable or disable the Bluetooth
adapter. It therefore requests the according Android permission to do
so. Usually, every module is specialized by a particular Android
permission.

/Modules/ are able to interact together. For example, having alone the
smsnotify module installed, will only show new SMS notifications with
the sender number, but not the name of the sender, since the smsnotify
module is unable to read your contacts. But if you install the
contactsread module, the smsnotify module will be able to query your
contacts for one with the given number.

/Transports/ send notifications to the user and receive commands.

/MAXS main/ glues together the different /modules/ and /transports/.

MAXS is heavily inspired by GTalkSMS, and hence it shares many ideas
with GTalkSMS. In fact we hope that MAXS will share the same feature
set as GTalkSMS at some point.

* Modular!

MAXS is split into a main component, which we refer to as /main/ from
now on, transport components and various modules. It is the job of
/main/ to forward incoming commands to the modules and send the answer
message from the modules back to the origin transport.

* What can MAXS do for me?

You can get notifications about events on your Android device. Typical
examples include 
- New SMS messages
- Incoming phone calls
- Current Battery state, i.e. percent and power supply source
  (AC/USB/Battery)

You are also able to control most aspects of your Android device. For
example:
- Send SMS messages
- Disable or enable the Bluetooth Adapter
- Query the contacts
- Set or retrieve the clipboard content

* How does it work?

MAXS commands are send from a /master JID/ over a transport component
(currently only XMPP) to the main component, which relays the commands
to the according module.

A command usually consists of a command string, a sub command string
and the optional arguments for the command. Usually the different
strings are separated by a single space, but in certain situations,
two spaces are required.

** Enabling or disabling the Bluetooth adapter

#+BEGIN_SRC
[17:14:02] User: bluetooth disable
[17:14:04] AndroidDevice: Disabling bluetooth adapter
[17:14:04] AndroidDevice: Bluetooth adapter changed state from 'on' to 'turning off'
[17:14:07] AndroidDevice: Bluetooth adapter changed state from
'turning off' to 'off'
#+END_SRC

** Retrieving the clipboard contents

#+BEGIN_SRC
[17:19:19] User: clipboard set This is now the content of the device's clipboard
[17:19:19] AndroidDevice: Clipboard set to: This is now the content of the device's clipboard
[17:19:28] User: clipboard get
[17:19:28] AndroidDevice: Clipboard: This is now the content of the
device's clipboard
#+END_SRC

** Receiving and sending SMS

#+BEGIN_SRC
[17:20:49] User: sms send Jane Doe  Have fun, see you later :)
[17:21:02] AndroidDevice: Sending SMS to Jane Doe (+49424242):
Have fun, see you later :)
[17:21:05] AndroidDevice: SMS sent to Jane Doe (+49424242): Have
fun, see you...
[17:21:07] AndroidDevice: Recent contact: Jane Doe (+49424242)
[17:21:14] AndroidDevice: SMS delivered to Jane Doe (+49424242):
Have fun, see you...
#+END_SRC

In this example =sms= is the command, and =send= is the sub
command. Everything after the =send= is the argument for the
command. Notice that *after the name, there are two spaces, to
distinguish the receivers name from the SMS body.

Also notice that sending a SMS also sets the /recent contact/ to the
receiver. The recent contact is used to remember the last contact the
user interacted with. It is, for example, also set when a new SMS
arrives and makes it easy to reply to the SMS message with the =reply
to= command/sub command.

#+BEGIN_SRC
[20:39:48] AndroidDevice: New SMS Received
Jane Doe (+49424242): How are you?
[20:39:52]: AndroidDevice: Recent contact: Jane Doe (+49424242)
[20:40:19] User: reply to Fine thanks :)
[20:40:22] AndroidDevice: SMS sent to Jane Doe (+49424242): Fine thanks :)
[20:40:27] AndroidDevice: SMS delivered to Jane Doe (+49424242): Fine thanks :)
#+END_SRC

Note that some commands have default sub commands if there is none
given. MAXS automatically inserts those commands. Furthermore there
are short commands for some commands. For example the short command
for =reply= is =r=. And since =to= is the default sub command for
=reply= one could also write simply =r= in the example above.

#+BEGIN_SRC
[20:39:48] AndroidDevice: New SMS Received
Jane Doe (+49424242): How are you?
[20:39:52] AndroidDevice: Recent contact: Jane Doe (+49424242)
[20:40:19] User: r Fine thanks :)
[20:40:22] AndroidDevice: SMS sent to Jane Doe (+49424242): Fine thanks :)
[20:40:27] AndroidDevice: SMS delivered to Jane Doe (+49424242): Fine thanks :)
#+END_SRC

** Display the current battery status

MAXS displays a few status items in the status string of your IM
system (e.g. XMPP presence status)

#+BEGIN_SRC
[22:08:20] My Droid is now Available (95-100% - Battery)
#+END_SRC

* What are the available commands?

Try sending simply =help= as command.
