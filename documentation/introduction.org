* What is MAXS?
MAXS is an acronym for *M* odular *A* ndroid *X* MPP *S* ervice. It is
an Android service that creates an XMPP connection and allows some
predefined JIDs, called /Master JIDs/, to use this service.

MAXS is heavily inspired by GTalkSMS, and hence it shares many ideas
with GTalkSMS. In fact we hope that MAXS will share the same feature
set as GTalkSMS at some point.

* Modular!
MAXS is split into a main component, which we refer to as /main/ from
now on, transport components and various modules. It is the job of
/main/ to forward incoming commands to the modules and send the answer
message from the modules back to the origin transport.
